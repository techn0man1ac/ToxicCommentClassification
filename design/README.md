# Project Overview

As a designer, my main responsibilities included creating visual design, ensuring an intuitive user interface, and developing a presentation to showcase our work.

## My Role as Designer

### UI/UX Design
I was responsible for designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the application. My process included:  
- **Research and Ideation**: Analyzing the project's goals to ensure the design aligns with the target audience's needs.  
- **Wireframing**: Creating low-fidelity wireframes to outline the application's structure and flow.  
- **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: Developing detailed, interactive prototypes in Figma that demonstrate the final look and feel of the app.  
- **User-Centric Approach**: Ensuring the interface is visually appealing and easy to use, contributing to a friendly user experience.
